In order to play this game, there are several steps you have to take before starting to play it. Because we’re using Bitmap, you must open up the Bitmap display from tools. After that, you must set it to 8x8 unit pixels with 512x512 display pixels and connect the base address to the heap memory. After that, you have to connect it to MIPS whichwill pair the Bitmap to the code. Then just assemble to code and run it, at this point you should be able to see the connect four board on the Bitmap. Once you have the game set up, player one will enter the number from 1 to 7, which will be the number of columns the player wants the chip to be placed in. The player should be able to see a green-colored chip in that column on Bitmap and hear the sound of the chip being placed too. After that, it’s the computer’s turn. At this point, the player doesn’t have to do anything but should be able to see a white-colored chip placed by the computer on the game board. After that, it's the player’s turn again. This will continue until someone wins. To win in this game, the player has to place four chips in a pattern. The pattern could be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. If the player wins, player will hear the winning sound and see the message saying that the player won. If the player loses, player will hear the losing sound and see the message saying that the player lost.
